# Fetch Rewards Coding Exercise - Analytics Engineer

This repository is created to answer the Fetch Rewards Coding Exercise for the position of Analytics Engineer. The project is divided into multiple parts:

## Part 1: ER-Diagram
- This section contains the **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ER-Diagram)** for the dataset.

## Part 2: Data, ETL Pipeline, and SQL Queries
- This section includes:
  - **Data**: The dataset used for analysis.
  - **ETL Pipeline**: The Python script responsible for the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process.
  - **SQL Queries**: SQL scripts that were used to answer the six questions posed by the exercise.
  
  **Important**:
  - The `initialize_db.py` script must be run **first** to set up the database.
  - After running `initialize_db.py`, run the `run_pipeline_etl.py` script. This will execute the pipeline and generate the `fetch_rewards.db` database.

## Part 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- This part contains a **Jupyter notebook** that performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**.
- The EDA is aimed at answering the questions posed in **Part 3** of the exercise.

## Part 4: Write-up and Final Answers
